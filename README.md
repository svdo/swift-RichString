## Introduction

This Swift framework was built to simplify working with `NSAttributedString`. It
does so without adding additional types; it just extends the existing types that
you already have, ensuring that it is fully interoperable with any other method
of using `NSAttributedString`.

The core assumption this framework makes, is that you set up your attributed
strings by first configuring all components appropriately, and then
concatenating them.

It allows you to do things like this:

```swift
let title = "This is a title".fontSize(17).color(.blue)
let text = "This is some text".paragraphStyle {
    $0.firstLineHeadIndent = 20
}
let content = title + text
```

## Overview

This framework provides the following primitives. There are unit tests; have a
look at them for more examples.

### Operator `+` For Concatenating Attributed Strings

Given two strings, you can append one to the other using the `+` operator:

```swift
let s1 = NSAttributedString()
let s2 = NSAttributedString()
let concatenated = s1 + s2
```

### `RichString` protocol for `String`, `NSString` and `NSAttributedString`

#### font(_:)

Apply the given font. The type `Font` is a type alias of `UIFont` on iOS, and of
`NSFont` on macOS.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".font(.systemFont(ofSize: 12))
```

#### fontSize(_:)

Applies the given font size. If no font was set on the attributed string yet,
`Font.systemFont` will be assumed.

Note: unlike on iOS, on macOS this returns an *optional* attributed string
instead.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".fontSize(12)
```

#### paragraphStyle(configure:)

Applies a paragraph style, configuring it with the given closure. If the
attributed string already had a paragraph style attribute, the `configure`
closure is called on that paragraph style; otherwise a new
`NSMutableParagraphStyle` is used.

```swift
let attributedString = "Hello World".paragraphStyle {
    $0.firstLineHeadIndent = 10
}
```

#### paragraphStyle(_:)

Applies the given paragraph style.

```swift
let paragraphStyle = NSMutableParagraphStyle()
paragraphStyle.firstLineHeadIndent = 10
let attributedString = "text".paragraphStyle(paragraphStyle)
```

#### color(_:)

Applies the given (foreground) color.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".color(.blue)
```

#### backgroundColor(_:)

Applies the given background color.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".backgroundColor(.yellow)
```

#### ligature(_:)

Configures whether or not to use ligatures. Default is that they are used.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".ligature(false)
```

#### kern(_:)

Configures the amount with which to modify the default kerning. The default `0`
means that no kerning change is applied.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".kern(0.1)
```

#### strikeThrough(style:)

Configures the strike through style. Please note that depending on OS and
version not all styles may actually work.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".strikeThrough(style: .styleSingle)
```

#### strikeThrough(color:)

Configures the strike through color. Only setting the color has no effect, the
style must be configured as well.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".strikeThrough(color: .red)
```

#### strikeThrough(color:, style:)

Configures both the strike through color and style. Please note that depending
on OS and version not all styles may actually work.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".strikeThrough(color: .red, style: .styleDouble)
```

#### underline(style:)

Configures the underline style. Please note that depending on OS and version not
all styles may actually work.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".underline(style: .styleSingle)
```

#### underline(color:)

Configures the underline color. Only setting the color has no effect, the style
must be configured as well.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".underline(color: .blue)
```

#### underline(color:, style:)

Configures both the underline color and style. Please note that depending on OS
and version not all styles may actually work.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".underline(color: .blue, style: .styleSingle)
```

#### stroke(width:, color:)

Configures the stroke.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".stroke(width: 2, color: .green)
```

#### shadow(configure:)

Configures the shadow using a closure that receives
an `NSShadow` instance. Not available on watchOS.

```swift
let result = "Hello World".shadow {
    $0.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 3, height: 3)
    $0.shadowBlurRadius = 2
    $0.shadowColor = Color.gray
}
```

#### shadow(_:)

Configures the shadow by setting an `NSShadow` instance. Not available on
watchOS.

```swift
let shadow = NSShadow()
shadow.shadowColor = .green
shadow.shadowBlurRadius = 2
shadow.shadowOffset = 3
let attributedString = "text".shadow(shadow)
```

#### letterPressed()

Adds the "letter pressed" text effect.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".letterPressed()
```

#### link(url:)

Creates hyperlink to the given URL with the receiver as text.

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://example.com")
let attributedString = "text".link(url: url)
```

#### link(string:)

Creates hyperlink to the given URL with the receiver as text.

```swift
let urlString = "https://example.com"
let attributedString = "text".link(string: urlString)
```

#### attachment(configure:)

Creates a new `NSTextAttachment` and passes it to the `configure` closure. Not
available on watchOS.

```swift
let attributedString = NSAttributedString().attachment {
    $0.image = UIImage(...)
    $0.bounds = CGRect(...)
}
```

#### baselineOffset(_:)

Configures the baseline offset.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".baselineOffset(-0.5)
```

#### obliqueness(_:)

Configures the skew to be applied to glyphs.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".obliqueness(1.5)
```

#### expansion(_:)

Configures the expansion to be applied to glyphs.

```swift
let attributedString = "text".expansion(2)
```

### `NSAttributedString` Extension for Getting Attribute Values

All of the above methods have corresponding getters to retrieve the attribute
values from the attributed string. The all return an optional; if the attribute
is not configured on the attributed string, `nil` will be returned.

The getters are:

- `attachment: NSTextAttachment?` (not available on watchOS)
- `backgroundColor: Color?`
- `baselineOffset: Float?`
- `color: Color?`
- `expansion: Float?`
- `fontSize: CGFloat?`
- `isLetterPressed: Bool?`
- `kern: Float?`
- `ligature: Bool?`
- `link: NSURL?`
- `obliqueness: Float?`
- `paragraphStyle: NSParagraphStyle?`
- `shadow: NSShadow?` (not available on watchOS)
- `strikeThroughColor: Color?`
- `strikeThroughStyle: NSUnderlineStyle?`
- `strokeColor: Color?`
- `strokeWidth: Float?`
- `underlineColor: Color?`
- `underlineStyle: NSUnderlineStyle?`

## Usage

You can use the library any way you like, but two easy ways are Carthage and
CocoaPods. For CocoaPods, put `pod RichString` in your `Podfile`.

## Alternative Frameworks

Back when I started, I found a couple other frameworks that have the same goal
as this one: simplifying using `NSAttributedString`. I like mine better, mostly
because it has a simpler API that doesn't use any additional types. But I'll let
you choose for yourself. I haven't researched this anymore after that, so this
is probably outdated.

[TextAttributes](https://github.com/delba/TextAttributes) is similar to this
framework, but it introduces a new type that you have to set up the attributes,
instead of working directly on the strings themselves. It doesn't feature the
cool closure-based way of setting up `shadow { ... }` and `paragraphStyle { ...
}` that this framework has. And it doesn't provide the super-convenient `+`
operator that this framework does. Finally, I didn't test this framework on tvOS
and watchOS. I'm rather confident that those will work as well, but you'll have
to try. Pull requests are wellcome of course.

[TextAttributesUtil](https://github.com/muukii/TextAttributesUtil) also
introduces a new type for setting up the attributes. Also, it's API forces you
to have more levels of nesting in your source code. It only supports iOS, not
macOS.
